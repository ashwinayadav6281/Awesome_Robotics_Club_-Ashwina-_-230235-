I had opted for Autonomous Navigation of Mars Rover and Robotic Arm as my preference for Summer Projects of Robotics Club.
I am really intrigued by space travel and space research, especially that related to the red planet, Mars. I am really excited to learn about navigation of rovers on the martian surface.
The fact that we could navigate rovers on Mars from 140 million miles away blows my mind and makes me eager to learn about it.
I have always wanted to join NASA and be a part of the amazing projects. 
A few years ago, I had watched the series "MARS" on National Geographic, about survival of man on Mars. It ignited my interest in this field and this project is just the right thing!

My second preference is Robotic Arm. The idea of a robotic arm really intrigued me and I am really looking forward to learning and innovating.
I would like to mention that I have sought help from online resources and chatgpt while completing these tasks. I am an amatuer in the field of robotics, with only limited knowledge of OpenCV or algorithms such as FABRIK.
I opted for Robotics club for Summer Projects because I wanted to learn about these things. I wanted to learn the ability to solve these tasks on my own without surfing the internet.
